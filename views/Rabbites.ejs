              <h3>ABOUT:Dutch bunny rabbit</h3>
              <p>The Dutch rabbit, also known as Hollander or Brabander is easily identifiable by its characteristic colour pattern, and was once the most popular of all rabbit breeds. However, after dwarf rabbits were developed, the popularity of the Dutch rabbit dwindled. Nevertheless, the Dutch rabbit remains one of the top ten most popular breeds worldwide</p>

        <h3>ABOUT:Feral Domestic Rabbit (Oryctolagus Cuniculus)</h3>
       <p>Rabbits were first used by the Romans as sources of food and fur, and have been kept as pets in Western nations since the 19th century.[1] Beginning in the 1980s, the idea of the domestic rabbit as a house companion, a so-called house rabbit, was promoted. Rabbits can be litter box-trained and come when called, but they need exercise and can damage a house that is not "rabbit proof</p>
